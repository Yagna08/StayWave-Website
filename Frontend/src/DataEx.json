They have a nice set up which provides you a homely environment. Ample space for kids to play. Mr. Bashir stayed with us for all four days but never gave us the feeling of owner. However, the wifi was not available for our whole stay due to cable break. Mr. Bashir tried hard to mend it but it was not restored. I will definetly recommend this place to those who need a peaceful and comfortable saty.",

Dr. Bashir is an extremely humble host & ensured that we had a pleasant stay. He actively interacts with you & goes beyond to ensure your stay is comfortable & without glitches. The property is exactly the way you in see in the photos posted - perfect. It is located just couple of kms off Dal Lake which makes it perfect for people travelling for sight seeing. <br/>Ishber is one of the premium location & you can expect absolute peace of mind in terms of security & privacy. It has access to good restaurants nearby. The property is ideal if you are travelling with family - as it just feels home away from home.",

In Kashmir to much power supply problem. In night time almost 5 to 6 hrs power cut observed. UPS Power backup is there but it not that much sufficient to hot water gear and hot blanket. In morning time you will not get electricity. Just go outside without taking bath. <br/>Over all experience is nice.",
